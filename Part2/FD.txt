-- a) Functional dependencies --

# REMOVE THIS LINE AND REPLACE IT WITH FDS ON THE FORM: a b -> c

studentIdnr -> studentName, branchName, programName, login

login -> studentIdnr

programName -> programAbbreviation 

courseCode -> courseName, capacity, credits, departmentName

-- b) BCNF schema --

# REMOVE THESE LINES AND REPLACE IT WITH A SCHEMA IN BCNF
# (use _underscore_ to mark keys, like in the ER-schema)

ROUND 1:
X = {studentIdnr}
FD = studentIdnr -> studentName, login, programName, branchName - BCNF VIOLATION

X+ = R2 = {studentIdnr, studentName, login, programName, branchName, programAbbreviation}

R1 - R2 = R3{studentIdnr, courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, departmentAbbreviation, capacity, grade, position}

ROUND 2:
FD = programName -> programAbbreviation - BCNF VIOLATION
R4 = {programName, programAbbreviation}

R2 - R4 = R5{studentIdnr, studentName, login, programName, branchName}

ROUND 3: 
FD = course -> courseName, credits, capacity, departmentAbbreviation - BCNF VIOLATION
R6 = {courseCode, courseName, credits, capacity, departmentAbbreviation, departmentName}

R3 - R6 = R7{studentIdnr, courseCode, grade, position}

ROUND 4:
R4 = {programName, programAbbreviation} is in BCNF

ROUND 5:
R5 = {studentIdnr, studentName, login, programName, branchName} is in BCNF

R7 = {studentIdnr, courseCode, grade, position} is in BCNF

ROUND 6:
FD departmentAbbreviation -> departmentName - BCNF VIOLATION
R8 = {departmentAbbreviation, departmentName}
R6 - R8 = R9{courseCode,departmentAbbreviation,courseName,credits,capacity}

SCHEMA:

-- c) 4NF additions --

MVD identified: #PUT YOUR MVD HERE ON THE FORM a b ->> c d
S = {courseCode, classification}
X = {courseCode}
Y = {classification}

courseCode ->> classification

R(courseCode, classification) 4NF VIOLATION
R1 = X ∪ Y = {courseCode, classification}
R2 = S − Y = {courseCode} -- NO MEANINGFUL RELATION IGNORE THIS

# REMOVE THESE LINES AND REPLACE IT WITH CHANGES MADE TO THE SCHEMA
# FROM b) AFTER 4NF NORMALIZATION (what relations are removed/added)
